# BGC lib

**Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Library** is a library with classes and methods that will allow easy manipulation and analysis of BGCs. 

Some of its classes and methods:

* HMM_DB: Stores information about hmm databases to be used with [HMMER](http://hmmer.org/)
  - Add hmm databases
  - Store aliases for known domains (e.g. "ketoacyl-synt" -> "KS")
  - Store domain colors

* BGCCollection: Intended for making whole-bgc set operations like:
  - Domain prediction (can also be done individually at the protein level)
  - Distance calculation (between e.g. two organism's BGCs, a new set of BGCs against a precomputed database, etc.)

* BGC: Main class. Will have BGCProtein objects associated to them (ideally through another level of organization: an object of the BGCLocus class) and supporting information to *classify* these clusters.

* BGCProtein: Currently the most worked on class. Some of its properties:
  - An object of this class can have three identifiers: the official `identifier` attribute (intended for a string of the type BGCName:CDS#:Ref_Accession), the original `accession` and a de-replicated `ref_accession` provided by [NCBI's IPG database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ipg)
