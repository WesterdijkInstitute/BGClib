# Empty lines  or lines starting with '#' are ignored
# This values can be used when drawing whole clusters, single proteins or

# For numerical values, integers are expected

# How many pixels per base pair i.e. the larger the number, the more 
# horizontally 'compressed' the arrows are. Default: 30
scaling=20

# Height of the arrows' body. Default: 30
arrow_height=40

# Arrow outline thickness. Default: 2
gene_contour_thickness=2

# Distance between the arrow's body and the domain-box

# Domain-box outline thickness
domain_contour_thickness=1

# Genomic stripe thickness
stripe_thickness=3

# Valid color modes for arrows's body: white (default), gray, random-pastel, random-dark, 
# random, roles, none and domains. For 'roles', putative roles in which the protein 
# is involved will be assumed based on their domain content. For 'domains' the
# arrow will be colored according to its domain (work in progress and experimental.
# Currently only works if there's only a single type of domain or the protein
# is a CBP. Domain boxes will be disabled)
color_mode=white

# Draw an outline for every arrow
outline=True

# Draw domains
draw_domains=True

# Use strand information contained in the original GenBank file. If false, arrows
# will point forward. This option is ignored when working with whole clusters
original_orientation=True

# Draw dotted lines in the positions where introns are located in the protein
# sequence
intron_break=False

# Draw the whole intron region. Overrides the intron_break option. Does not work
# yet with domain box figures
intron_regions=True


# Options for BGCtoolkit
# How much spacing to leave between BGCs for the comparative connecting bands. 
#  The number is in terms of BGC height, [1.0,inf]
comparative_figure_spacing=1.0
